Well, this is the readme file for my Final Year Project. I will be updating all the things here by the time I make any changes in this project. I will be working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) algoritms to create text summary of video lectures.

when world was hit by cov'19 and universities were closed, teachers were giving online lectures which were saved on some protal and student has to go through the whole lecture to know what is this lecture is about, so this idea will save their time by giving them the text summary to have an overview or recall the lecture.

This project is divided into 3 parts,
First is about to convert video into audio file then convert that audio file into text using recognizer which is done by moviepy and SpeechRecognition libraries(in python)
 
moviepy library is used to convert the video lecture into audio 
HOW TO INSTALL moviepy?
you can simply install the moviepy library in panel by this command
pip install moviepy


SpeechRecognition library is used to convert the audio of lecture into text 
HOW TO INSTALL SpeechRecognition?
you can simply install the SpeechRecognition library in panel by this command
