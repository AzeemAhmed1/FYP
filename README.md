Well, this is the readme file for my Final Year Project. I will be updating all the things here by the time I make any changes in this project. My supervisor advised me to learn about IBM Watson as I will be working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) algoritms to create text summary of video lectures.

IBM's Watson is a super computer which is not only working in IT but also providing its services buisiness automation, advertising, video streaming, healthcare.

Watson is also understands NLP, it is a sub field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the parsing of human language into its elemental pieces. By combining computational linguistics with statistical machine learning techniques and deep learning models, NLP enables computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data.
