The public sphere is the easy but the more difficult path for asking and was having to read through the most troubling historical texts and records how much time in history when africans were on the receiving end of colonial force violence and discrimination was texts are still difficult to read even today in two years we collect the data more than 30 2008 held by these institutions that might seem like a huge number of there are many other decisions that haven't replied to a request and that's just can you they are 46 other countries in sub-saharan africa that of experience similar extraction of objects or next step is to publish this database online so the data is accessible community leaders were complaining of the return of sikander objects are also for every teacher research and citizen want to find out what we are missing and where can be found in the only eva kind across africa and asia there are other projects asking similar questions about their cultural heritage i hope that we can provoke institutions in north america and europe to rethink the morality of their collections we ask them to account for the violent histories of some of the objects in their collections by labelling the collections more truthfully we ask in a return object property acquired back to the community that need them we are still have to trust african museums to store objects on behalf of the people of africa that can be no collective identity without collective memory soya asking for objects to help us remember who we thank you. \n"
